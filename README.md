### PicTagger v2  
A complete rework of a project I did in school. I was proud of it at the time, but it was janky, slow, and destroyed databases with exponential growth. This project aims to fix all of that and even add a fresh coat of paint  
Created with 'create-react-app' + typescript  
Also I'll probably learn SASS while I'm here  

*Bootstrapped with create-react-app + typescript*
