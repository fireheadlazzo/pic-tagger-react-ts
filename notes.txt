Q: Why can't Component be imported alongside React anymore?
A: 
Q: What is a helm file? What does it do?
A: 
Q: How does the example build process work? Why does it appear to do things multiple times?
A: Because it does, and for a good reason.
   First, it runs npm install while it's still in the pre-build phase
   Next, it runs all of the unit tests. If these fail, the whole build will fail
   Next it builds the application like normal
   Then it does Docker stuff. It sets the docker context to the latest build
   Then it runs Docker build
     This triggers the Dockerfile script, which copies the relevant files from the build
     then npm install must be run again on the new build/ directory
Q: Multer?
A: It handles multi-part form data. It is not specifically an image handler, but it does load the file into memory and places limits on file sizes
   In the example code, it gets passed "file" to indicate that it should pull req.body.file off, run it through multer, and put the file directly on req
